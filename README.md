# Cairo-Shell-Script
A simple script for cairo because I hate their terminal commands. 

### How To Use

* You'll first need to set up your cairo enviroment follow the instructions [here](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html)

* Add the script to the project folder you are working in 

* Enable it in your linux distro of choice: ```chmod +x script.sh```
* Then simply use ```./script.sh```

### Conclusion
I'll be adding more options and what not as I learn more about cairo (I'm sure there are more tedious commands)

P.S. If you hate having to always use ```source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate``` then just go to your distro's .bashrc and add ```alias cairo='source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate'``` under ```# Alias definitions```
